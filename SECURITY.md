## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping this project secure.

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send an email to the maintainers through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. Include as much information as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
- **Timeline**: We aim to provide an initial response within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within 30 days
- **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

When using this repository:

### For Scripts and Code

- **Never commit credentials** - Use environment variables or secure credential stores
- **Validate all inputs** - Especially in automation scripts
- **Use secure connections** - Always use HTTPS/SSL for vCenter connections
- **Follow least privilege** - Use service accounts with minimal required permissions
- **Regular updates** - Keep PowerCLI and Python libraries updated

### For Lab Environments

- **Isolate lab networks** - Don't connect lab environments to production networks
- **Use strong passwords** - Follow VMware password complexity requirements
- **Enable logging** - Monitor access and changes in lab environments
- **Regular backups** - Backup configurations and important data
- **Patch management** - Keep ESXi and vCenter updated with latest patches

### For Production Use

- **Code review** - Review all scripts before production deployment
- **Testing** - Test thoroughly in non-production environments
- **Change management** - Follow proper change control procedures
- **Monitoring** - Implement proper logging and monitoring
- **Documentation** - Document all customizations and configurations

## Security Features

This repository implements several security measures:

### Code Quality

- Automated security scanning via GitHub Actions
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code quality checks and linting
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data

### Documentation

- Security best practices documentation
- Secure configuration examples
- Vulnerability disclosure process
- Regular security updates

## Known Security Considerations

### PowerCLI Scripts

- Scripts may require elevated privileges
- Always validate server certificates in production
- Use secure credential storage mechanisms
- Implement proper error handling to avoid information disclosure

### Python Scripts

- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
- Validate SSL certificates for API connections
- Implement proper exception handling
- Use secure coding practices for input validation

### Lab Environments

- Nested virtualization may have security implications
- Lab credentials should not be used in production
- Network isolation is recommended for lab environments
- Regular cleanup of test data and configurations

## Compliance

This project aims to align with:

- VMware security best practices
- Industry standard secure coding practices
- OWASP guidelines for secure development
- Common security frameworks and standards

## Updates and Notifications

- Security updates will be announced in release notes
- Critical vulnerabilities will be communicated via GitHub Security Advisories
- Subscribe to repository notifications for security updates
- Follow VMware security advisories for platform-specific updates
